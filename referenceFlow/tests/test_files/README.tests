Most of the regression tests now run spike as part of testing rather than storing trace files
in the repository.

Special case handling
---------------------

However, there are some cases which need special handling to produce the spike trace and this is
handled by having a file with the .spike_pc_trace extension. This is then picked up by the
regression script (scripts/ci/run_regression.sh) instead of attempting to run spike.

e.g. xrle.spike_pc_trace
