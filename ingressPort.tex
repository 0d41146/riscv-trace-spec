\section{Interface requirements}
This section describes in general terms the information which must be passed from the RISC-V hart to the trace encoder,
and distinguishes between what is mandatory, and what is optional.

The following information is mandatory:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The number of instructions that are being retired;
  \item Whether there has been an exception or interrupt, and if so the cause (from the \textbf{\textit{ucause/scause/mcause}} CSR)
        and trap value (from the \textbf{\textit{utval/stval/mtval}} CSR);
  \item The current privilege level of the RISC-V hart;
  \item The \textit{instruction\_type} of retired instructions for:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Jumps with a target that cannot be inferred from the source code;
      \item Taken branches;
      \item Return from exception or interrupt (\textbf{\textit{*ret}} instructions).
    \end{itemize}
  \item The \textit{instruction\_address} for:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Jumps with a target that \textit{cannot} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Taken branches;
      \item The instruction executed immediately after a jump or taken branch (also referred to as the target or destination of the jump or taken branch);
      \item The last instruction executed before an exception or interrupt;
      \item Exceptions;
      \item The first instruction executed following an exception or interrupt;
      \item The last instruction executed before a privilege change;
      \item The first instruction executed following a privilege change;
      \item The first and last instruction being retired.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The number of nontaken branches being retired.
\end{itemize}

The following information is optional:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Context information:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The context and/or hart ID;
      \item The type of action to take when context changes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The \textit{instruction\_type} of instructions for:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Calls with a target that \textit{cannot} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Calls with a target that \textit{can} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Tail-calls with a target that \textit{cannot} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Tail-calls with a target that \textit{can} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Returns with a target that \textit{cannot} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Returns with a target that \textit{can} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Co-routine swap;
      \item Jumps which don't fit any of the above classifications with a target that \textit{cannot} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Jumps which don't fit any of the above classifications with a target that \textit{can} be inferred from the source code;
      \item Nontaken branches.
    \end{itemize}
  \item If context is supported then the \textit{instruction\_address} for:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The last instruction executed before a context change;
      \item The first instruction executed following a context change.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Whether jump targets are sequentially inferable or not.
\end{itemize}

The mandatory information is the bare-minimum required to implement the branch trace algorithm outlined in Chapter~\ref{Algorithm}.  
The optional information facilitates alternative or improved trace algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implicit return mode (see Section~\ref{sec:implicit-return}) requires the encoder to keep track of the number of nested 
    function calls, and to do this it must be aware of all calls and returns regardless of whether the target can be inferred or not;
  \item A simpler algorithm useful for basic code profiling would only report function calls and returns, again 
    regardless of whether the target can be inferred or not;
  \item Branch prediction techniques can be used to further improve the encoder efficiency, particularly for loops 
    (see Section~\ref{sec:branch-prediction}).  This requires the encoder to be aware of the address of all branches, whether
    they are taken or not.
  \item Uninferable jumps can be treated as inferable (which don't need to be reported in the trace output) if both the jump 
    and the preceding instruction which loads the target into a register have been traced.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Jump classification and target inference} \label{Jump Classes}

Jumps are classified as \textit{inferable}, or \textit{uninferable}.  An \textit{inferable} jump has a target which can be
deduced from the binary executable or representation thereof (e.g. ELF).  For the purposes of this specification, the following 
strict definition applies:

If the target of a jump is supplied via a constant embedded within the jump opcode, it is classified as \textit{inferable}.
Jumps which are not \textit{inferable} are by definition \textit{uninferable}.

However, there are some jump targets which can still be deduced from the binary executable by considering pairs of instructions
even though by the above definition they are classified as uninferable.  Specifically, jump targets that are supplied via

\begin{itemize}
  \item an \textbf{\textit{lui}} or \textbf{\textit{c.lui}} (a register which contains a constant), or
  \item an \textbf{\textit{auipc}} (a register which contains a constant offset from the PC).
\end{itemize}

Such jump targets are classified as \textit{sequentially inferable} if the pair of instructions are executed consecutively 
(i.e. the \textbf{\textit{auipc}}, \textbf{\textit{lui}} or \textbf{\textit{c.lui}} immediately precedes the jump).  Note:
the restriction that the instructions are executed consecutively is necessary in order to minimize the additional signalling
needed between the hart and the encoder, and should have a minimal impact on trace efficiency as it is anticipated that
consecutive execution will be the norm. Support for sequentially inferable jumps is optional.

Jumps may optionally be further classified according to the recommended calling convention:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Calls}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{\textit{jal}} x1;
      \item \textbf{\textit{jal}} x5;
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} x1, rs  where rs != x1;
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} x5, rs  where rs != x5;
      \item \textbf{\textit{c.jalr}} rs1.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Tail-calls}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} x0, rs where rs != x1 and rs != x5;
      \item \textbf{\textit{c.jr}} rs1 where rs1 != x1 and rs1 != x5.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Returns}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} x0, rs where rs == x1 or rs == x5;
      \item \textbf{\textit{c.jr}} rs1 where rs1 == x1 or rs1 == x5.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Co-routine swap}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} x1, x1;
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} x5, x5.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Other}: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{\textit{jal}} rd where rd != x1 and rd != x5;
      \item \textbf{\textit{jalr}} rd, rs where rd != x0 and rd != x1 and rd != x5.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

Tables~\ref{tab:common-ingress}, ~\ref{tab:multi-ingress} and ~\ref{tab:multintb-ingress}
list the signals in the interface designed to efficiently support retirement of multiple 
instructions per cycle.  The following discussion describes the multiple-retirement behavior.  
However, for harts that can only retire one instruction at a time, the signalling can be 
simplified, and this is discussed subsequently in Section~\ref{sec:single-retire}.  

The information presented on the ingress port represents a contiguous
block of instructions starting at \textbf{iaddr}, all of which retired
in the same cycle. Note if \textbf{itype} is 1 or 2 (indicating an
exception or an interrupt), the number of instructions retired may be
zero. \textbf{cause} and \textbf{tval} are only defined if
\textbf{itype} is 1 or 2. If \textbf{iretire}=0 and \textbf{itype}=0,
the values of all other signals are undefined.

\textbf{iretire} contains the number of half-words represented by
instructions retired in this block, and \textbf{ilastsize} the size of the last
instruction.  Half-words rather than instruction count enables the encoder to easily compute the address of
the last instruction in the block without having access to the size of every 
instruction in the block.  

If address translation is enabled, \textbf{iaddr} is a virtual
address, else it is a physical address. Virtual addresses narrower
than \textit{iaddress\_width\_p} bits must be sign-extended to make
computation of differential addresses easier, and physical addresses
narrower than \textit{iaddress\_width\_p} bits must be zero-extended.

Cores can retire multiple non-taken branches per clock cycle, indicated via \textbf{ntkn}.
However, a consequence of this is that the encoder will be unaware of the addresses of some non-taken branches, 
which will prevent the use of a branch predictor to improve compression (see Section~\ref{sec:branch-prediction}).
For harts that can only retire a maximum of one non-taken branch per clock cycle,
\textbf{ntkn} can be omitted, provided all non-taken branches are indicated via \textbf{itype}.  
The number of non-taken branches is \textbf{ntkn} if \textbf{ntkn} is non-zero, or 1 if \textbf{itype} = 4 and \textbf{ntkn} is zero.
In other words, if for example \textbf{ntkn} is 2 and \textbf{itype} = 4, the encoder will interpret this as 2 non-taken branches,
not 3.

For harts that can retire a maximum of N taken branches per clock
cycle, the signal group (\textbf{iretire}, \textbf{itype},
\textbf{ntkn} (if present), \textbf{ilastsize}, \textbf{iaddr}) must be replicated N times. Signal group 0
represents information about the oldest instruction block, and group N-1
represents the newest instruction block. The interface supports no more
than one privilege, context, exception or interrupt per cycle and so \textbf{priv}, 
\textbf{context}, \textbf{context\_type}, \textbf{cause} and
\textbf{tval} are not replicated. Furthermore, \textbf{itype} can only
take the value 1 or 2 in one of the signal groups, and this must be
the newest valid group (i.e. \textbf{iretire} and \textbf{itype} must
be zero for higher numbered groups). If fewer than N taken branches
are retired in a cycle, then lower numbered groups must be used
first. For example, if there is one taken branch, use only group 0, if
there are two taken branches, instructions up to the 1st taken branch
must be reported in group 0 and instructions up to the 2nd taken branch
must be reported in group 1 and so on.

\textbf{sijump} is optional and may be omitted if the hart does not implement the logic to detect
sequentially inferable jumps.  If the encoder offers an \textbf{sijump} input it must also provide a
parameter to indicate whether the input is connected to a hart that implements this capability, or
tied off.  This is to ensure the decoder can be made aware of the hart's capability.  Enabling 
sequentially inferable jump mode in the encoder and decoder when the hart does not support it will
prevent correct reconstruction by the decoder. 

The \textbf{context} field can be used to convey any additional information to the decoder.  For example:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The hart ID;
  \item The software thread ID;
  \item It could be used to convey the values of CSRs to the decoder by setting \textbf{context} to the 
    CSR number and value when a CSR is written.
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:context-type} specifies the actions for the various \textbf{context\_type} values.

        Need to report the last instruction executed on the previous context, as well as the 1st on the new context.\newline
        Treated the same as an exception.\\
        \hline
        Precise context change & 1 & Need to output the address of the 1st instruction, and the new context.\newline
        If there were unreported branches beforehand, these need to be output first.\newline
        Treated the same as a privilege change.\\
        \hline
        Imprecise context change & 2 & An example would be a SW thread change.\newline
        Report the new context value at the earliest convenient opportunity.\newline
        It is reported without any address information, and the assumption is that the precise point of context change can be deduced from the source code (e.g. a CSR write). \\
        \hline
        Notification & 3 & An example would be a \textit{Trace-Notify} from the hart's trigger unit (see section~\ref{sec:trigger}).\newline
        Need to output the address of the last instruction in the block.\newline
        The context itself is not output.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabulary}
\end{table}

\subsection{Simplifications for single-retirement} \label{sec:single-retire}

For harts that can only retire one instruction at a time, the interface can be simplified to
the signals listed in tables~\ref{tab:common-ingress} and ~\ref{tab:single-ingress}.  The 
simplifications can be summarized as follows:
 
\begin{itemize}
  \item As the number of instructions that are retired in a block is only 0 or 1, the 
    encoder does not need information to enable it to deduce the address of the last instruction 
    retired (it is the same as the 1st and only instruction retired).  So 
    \textbf{ilastsize} is not necessary, and \textbf{iretire} simply indicates whether an
    instruction retired or not;
  \item As the number of non-taken branches retired is never more than 1, and can always
    be indicated via \textbf{itype}, \textbf{ntkn} is not necessary.
\end{itemize}

The parameter \textit{retires\_p} which indicates to the encoder the maximum number of 
instructions that can be retired per cycle can be used by an encoder capable of supporting single or 
multiple retirement to select the appropriate interpretation of \textbf{iretire}.  
\textbf{ilastsize} and \textbf{ntkn} encoder inputs must be tied low when attached to a single-retirement
hart that does not provide these outputs.


\subsection{Alternative multiple-retirement interface configurations}

For a hart that can retire multiple instructions per cycle, but no more than one taken branch, the preferred 
solution is to use one of each of the signals from tables~\ref{tab:common-ingress}, ~\ref{tab:multi-ingress} and 
optionally ~\ref{tab:multintb-ingress}.  However, an alternative approach would be to provide explicit details of every 
instruction retired by using N sets of the signal group (\textbf{iretire}, \textbf{itype}) from 
tables~\ref{tab:common-ingress} and ~\ref{tab:single-ingress} with the groups detailing one instruction each 
(replicating the single retirement example N times).  

\subsection{Optional sideband signals}

Optional sideband signals may be included to provide additional functionality, as described in
tables \ref{tab:ingress-side-band} and \ref{tab:egress-side-band}.

Note, any user defined information that needs to be output by the encoder
will need to be applied via the \textbf{context} input.

\begin{table}[htp]

        \hline
        \textbf{impdef}[\textit{impdef\_width\_p}-1:0] &  Implementation defined sideband signals.  A typical use for
        these would be for filtering (see Chapter~\ref{ch:filtering}.\\
        \hline
        \textbf{trigger}[1:0] & A pulse on bit 0 will cause the encoder to start tracing, and continue until further 
        notice, subject to other filtering criteria also being met.\newline
        A pulse on bit 1 will cause the encoder to stop tracing until further notice.  See section~\ref{sec:trigger}).\\
        \hline
        \textbf{halted}& Core is halted.  Upon assertion, the encoder will output a packet to report the address 
        of the last instruction retired before halting, followed by a support packet to indicate that tracing has stopped. 
        Upon deassertion, the encoder will start tracing again, commencing with a synchronisation packet.\\
        \hline
        \textbf{reset}& Core is in reset.  Provided the encoder is in a different reset domain to the hart, this
        allows the encoder to indicate that tracing has ended on entry to reset, and restarted on exit.  
        Behavior is as described above for halt.\\

        \textbf{stall}& Stall request to hart.  Some applications may require lossless trace, which can be achieved by
        using this signal to stall the hart if the trace encoder is unable to output a trace packet (for example due to 
        back-pressure from the packet transport infrastructure).\\

\subsection{Using trigger outputs from the Debug Module} \label{sec:trigger}

The debug module of the RISC-V hart may have a trigger unit. This defines a match control register
(\textbf{\textit{mcontrol}}) containing a 4-bit \textbf{action} field, and reserves codes 2 - 5 
of this field for trace use.  
These action codes are hereby defined as shown in table \ref{tab:debugModuleTriggerSupport}.
The table also includes details of how these actions should be comunicated to the trace encoder.

\begin{table}[!h]
    \centering
    \caption{Debug Module trigger support (\textbf{\textit{mcontrol}} \textbf{action})}
    \label{tab:debugModuleTriggerSupport}
    \begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{|l|p{120mm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf {Value} & \textbf {Description} \\
        \hline
        2 & \textit{Trace-on}.  Generate a pulse on an output from the hart.  This should be connected to 
        \textbf{trigger[0]} if the encoder provides it. \\ 
        \hline
        3 & \textit{Trace-off}.  Generate a pulse on an output from the hart.  This should be connected to 
        \textbf{trigger[1]} if the encoder provides it. \\
        \hline
        4 & \textit{Trace-notify}.  Set the \textbf{context\_type} encoder input to 'Notification' for the
        block of instructions that ends with the instruction that caused the triggered the notification. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabulary}
\end{table}

Trace-on and Trace-off actions provide a means for the hart to control when tracing occurs.  
Trace-notify provides  means to ensure that a specified instruction is explicitly reported.  
This capability is sometimes known as a watchpoint.
