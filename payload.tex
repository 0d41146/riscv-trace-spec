\chapter{Trace Encoder Output Packets} \label{packets}

Figure~\ref{fig:packet-format} gives an example of a possible basic structure for 
packets emerging from the encoder, in network order (1st transmitted byte is on the left).
This shows how the payload maybe encapsulated.  The header includes the packet length, and 
the index identifies the source of the packet.  
Different instantiations or implementations may have different encapsulating structures.  
This will typically be dependent upon such things as the trace routing infrastructure within the 
SoC.  In order to support this, the encoder must provide the following information to the encapsulator:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The packet type;
  \item The packet length, in bytes;
  \item The packet payload.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this section describes the contents of the payload
portion which should be independent of the infrastructure.  In each table, the fields are listed in
transmission order: first field in the table is transmited first, and multi-bit fields are 
transmitted LSB first.

  \label{fig:packet-format}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


This packet payload format is used to output encoded instruction
trace.  Four different formats are used according to the needs of the
encoding algorithm. The following tables show the format of the
payload - i.e. excluding any encapsulation.

In order to achieve best performance, actual packet lengths may be adjusted using 'sign based compression'.
At the very minimum this should be applied to the address field, but ideally will be applied to the whole 
packet.  This technique eliminates identical bits from the most significant end of the packet, and adjusts
the length of the packet accordingly.  A decoder receiving this shortened packet can reconstruct the 
original full-length packet by sign-extending from the most significant received bit.  An example of how
this technique is used to choose between address formats is given in Section~\ref{addresses}.  The same
principal can be applied to the entire packet, and the length (typically given in bytes) adjusted 
accordingly.

Where the payload length given in the following tables, or after applying sign-based compression, is not a 
multiple of whole bytes in length, the payload must be sign-extended to the nearest byte boundary.

Whilst offering maximum encoding efficiency, variable length packets can present some challenges,
specifically in terms of identifying where the boundaries between packets occur either when packed
packets are written to memory, or when packets are streamed offchip via a communications channel.  Two 
potential solutions to this are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the maximum packet payload length is 2\textsuperscript{N}-1 (for example, if N is 5, then the maximum length is
    31 bytes), and the minimum packet payload length is 1, then a sequence of at least 2\textsuperscript{N} zero 
    bytes cannot occur within a packet payload, and therefore the first non-zero byte seen after a sequence of 
    at least 2\textsuperscript{N} zero bytes must be the first byte of a packet.  This approach can be used for
    alignment in either memory or a data stream;
  \item An alternative approach suitable for packets written to memory is to divide memory into blocks of M bytes
    (e.g. 1kbyte blocks), and write packets to memory such that the first byte in every block is always the first
    byte of a packet.  This means packets cannot span block boundaries, and so zero bytes must be used to pad between 
    the end of the last message in a block and the block boundary.
\end{itemize}
