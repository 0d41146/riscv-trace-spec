== Future Directions

This chapter captures ideas and enhancements that may be useful for to
consider in future versions of the E-Trace specification.

=== Vector

Now that the vector extension has been ratified it would be interesting
to look at extending E-Trace to support instruction and data trace for
vector operations.

=== Inter-instruction cycle counts

In this mode the encoder will trace where the hart is stalling by
reporting the number of cycles between successive instruction
retirements.
